        <h2 id="ty1">Types of Hot Coffee Drinks</h2>
        <h3 id="bl1">Black Coffee :
        </h3>
        <p id="no1">No frills here: Black coffee is made from plain ground coffee beans that are brewed hot. It's served without added sugar, milk, or flavorings.</p>
        <h3 id="dec">Decaf :</h3>
        <p id="bean1">Coffee beans naturally contain caffeine, but roasters can use  different processes to remove almost all of it. Decaf coffee is brewed with these decaffeinated beans.</p>
        <h3 id="esp1">Espresso :</h3>
        <p id="sin1">A single espresso is a one-ounce shot. It's also the base for popular coffee-shop drinks like lattes and cappuccinos.</p>
        <h3 id="latt1">Latte :</h3>
        <p id="latt2">This classic drink is  1/3 espresso and 2/3 steamed milk, topped with a thin layer of foam, but coffee shops have come up with seemingly endless customizations.</p>
        <h3 id="capp1">Cappuccino :</h3>
        <p id="capp2">This drink is similar to a latte, but the frothy top layer is thicker.The ratio is equal parts espresso, steamed milk, and foam. It's often served in a 6-ounce cup.</p>
        <h3 id="mach1">Macchiato :</h3>
        <p id="mach2">A macchiato is a shot of espresso with just a touch of steamed milk or foam. In Italian, macchiato means "stained" so a caffè macchiato refers to coffee that's been stained with milk.</p>
        <h3 id="cort1">Cortado :</h3>
        <p id="cort2">This drink, which hails from Spain, is half espresso, half steamed milk. Unlike many Italian coffee drinks, it contains little to no foam. It's typically served in a 4.5-ounce glass.</p>
